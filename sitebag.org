** Implementation notes

** Issues

*** TODO pdf support                                                  :r0.2.0:

When a link to a pdf file is sent to sitebag, it should try to extract
the contents using some library like [[http://pdfbox.apache.org][pdfbox]] or [[http://tika.apache.org][tika]].

*** TODO provide sitebag links in content                             :r0.2.0:

- all links in a page should be rewritten to sitebag-internal links if
  the page exists
- if not, provide a link that adds it

*** BUG support txt files                                             :r0.2.0:

TXT files are poorly converted into html. They are not readable, since
they are stored as is. It needs to be wrapped in some simple html;
like wrap all paragraphs in <p/>s.

*** TODO refactor client javascript

this is a mess right now... 

*** TODO delete/rename tags

*** TODO share links via email

- share sitebag links via email
- use original links or create a public url to the sitebag link?

*** TODO i18n 

pages and server responses should be localized

*** TODO show similiar entries

try to find simliar entries in sitebag and list them

*** TODO provide api to verify tag and account names

- this could aid ui of rest clients 

*** TODO support for video files

video files should be stored like images in sitebag (make it configureable)

*** TODO show some simple stats

- group by url/host
- number of articles
- ...?

*** TODO registration of new users via web

- new users can register themselves via web interface
- admin can set a "invitation key", to prevent anonymous registration

*** TODO import/export of all data

Since mongo is the only supported db, this could be simply a mongo
dump...
