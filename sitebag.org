** Implementation notes

** Issues
*** TODO make "api home" endpoint
    [2014-06-06]

    There should be a "home" like endpoint, like "/api" that returns a
    map of endpoints.

    This would reduce client impls, they would need to lookup in this
    map the other endpoints. The keys must be stable (belong to
    sitebag's public api).
   
*** TODO pdf support

    :PROPERTIES: 
    :release:  0.3.0
    :END:

    When a link to a pdf file is sent to sitebag, it should try to
    extract the contents using some library like [[http://pdfbox.apache.org][pdfbox]] or [[http://tika.apache.org][tika]].

*** DONE provide sitebag links in content
    CLOSED: [2014-06-07 Sa 00:23]

    :PROPERTIES: 
    :release:  0.2.0
    :END:

    The page entry contains links to other pages. Those links should
    be rewritten, such that they point to the version in sitebag
    instead. If they're not added, another link needs to be included,
    that would add it to sitebag.

*** BUG support txt files

    :PROPERTIES: 
    :release:  0.2.0
    :END:

    TXT files are poorly converted into html. They are not readable,
    since they are stored as is. It needs to be wrapped in some simple
    html; like wrap all paragraphs in <p/>s.

*** TODO refactor client javascript

    this is a mess right now... 

*** TODO delete/rename tags

*** TODO share links via email

    - share sitebag links via email
    - use original links or create a public url to the sitebag link?

*** TODO i18n 

    pages and server responses should be localized

*** TODO show similiar entries

    try to find simliar entries in sitebag and list them

*** TODO provide api to verify tag and account names

    - this could aid ui of rest clients 

*** TODO support for video files

    video files should be stored like images in sitebag (make it configureable)

*** TODO show some simple stats

    - group by url/host
    - number of articles
    - ...?

*** TODO registration of new users via web

    - new users can register themselves via web interface
    - admin can set a "invitation key", to prevent anonymous registration

*** TODO import/export of all data

    Since mongo is the only supported db, this could be simply a mongo
    dump...
